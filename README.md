  Bathtub Challenge 
</h1>

<p><font size="3">
  This is a mini App built using <strong><em>React.JS</em></strong>, <strong><em>Styled-Conmponents</em></strong> and <strong><em>Material-UI</em></strong>
  <br><br> 
	 This project is about building a web application that allows users to fill a bathtub with water or empty the bathtub by using the following instructions: 

* The app starts with an empty bathtub.
* To fill the bathtub with water click on the "Water ON" button, the water will start filling the bathtub by 20% every 2 seconds, when the bathtub is full the water will stop automatically.
* To empty the bathtub click on the "Water OFF" button, the water will start decreasing by 20% every 2 seconds until the bathtub became empty.
* If you tried to fill the bathtub while it's already full, the app will show a message that "The bathtub is full !".
* If you tried to empty the bathtub while it's already empty,  the app will show a message that "The bathtub is empty !".
* You can switch between buttons to increase or decrease the water at anytime.
